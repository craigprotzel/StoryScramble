This is my NYU ITP Master's Thesis project, "StoryScramble."
It is a web-based application designed spcifically for people with early stage memory loss.
I am working in conjunction with the NY Alzheimer's Association in hopes of creating a web-based game that would be usable by their clients.

The site uses the ExpressJS framework with NodeJS.  
The web app uses EJS as a template language. 

Template files are in the /views folder.
Static files are in the /static folder

Before running locally run the command 
npm install
This will install all dependencies in the package.json file.

I am accessing the USA Today API to obtain site content and storing that data in a MongoLab Db.
I am also using one local storage variable to track the user's topic choice

The files were created from the Heroku tutorial, "Getting Started with Node.js on Heroku/Cedar" http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js
