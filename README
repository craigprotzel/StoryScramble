This project is a demo for the Dynamic Web Development class at ITP/NYU

It demonstrates using ExpressJS framework with NodeJS for a multi-page website. The web app uses EJS as a template language. 

- Template files are in the /views folder.
- Static files are in the /static folder

Before running locally run the command 
npm install

this will install all dependencies in the package.json file.

To run locally, navigate to the code directory in Terminal, run 
node web.js

Visit the site on your browser at http://localhost:3000
