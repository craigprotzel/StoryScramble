This is my NYU ITP Master's Thesis project, "Story Scramble."
It's a web-based application designed specifically for people with early stage memory loss.
I'm working in conjunction with the NY Alzheimer's Association in hopes of creating a web-based game that will be usable by their clients.

The site uses the ExpressJS framework with NodeJS and EJS as a template language. 

Template files are in the /views folder.
Static files are in the /static folder

Before running locally run the command 
npm install
This will install all dependencies in the package.json file.

I'm accessing the USA Today API to obtain site content and the Diffbot API to show the article text on the page. 

Back-end data is being stored in a MongoLab DB.
I'm also using one local storage variable to track the user's "topic" choice

The files were created with a great deal of help from John Schimmel (https://github.com/johnschimmel) and the Heroku tutorial, "Getting Started with Node.js on Heroku/Cedar" http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js

Also, I owe a great deal of gratitude to Jeremy Scott-Diamond (http://www.jeremyscottdiamond.com/) and Martin Bravo (http://www.bravomartin.cl/) for their technical and creative help. Could not have done this without them.
